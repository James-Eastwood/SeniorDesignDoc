# Speedy Speed Bois
## A Team CDJ Project
### Colin Tierney, David Collins, James Eastwood

This website houses documentation for our senior design project. 
This year, the three of us are collaborating on a project that 
incorporates both software and hardware. There are three main 
aspects to this project. 
- Software (Game)
- Hardware
- Embedded Software

Throughout the year, this website will be updated with our findings and methods. As this
is a living document, it is subject to missing features, spelling mistakes, and poor
grammar. The goal is to just get something on the page for now, and as our project nears
our due date, it'll be all spiffy and clean. Please excuse our poor typing skills for the
moment.

### Software (Game)
A big portion of this project is a racing/drift game made in the Unity game engine. We are
using our previous software skills to learn about C#, the main programming language used
by Unity. Some main features of the game include:
- Various Game Modes
    - Tofu Time Trial Mode
    - Race Mode
    - Race Mode (Cat and Mouse)
    - Free Drive
- Various Speed Classes
- Car Customization
- Various Maps/Stages
- Custom Soundtrack

Additionally, we created various programs and scripts as utilities to help us in the 
development of the hardware and software. More information on these utilities can be found
in their respective pages.

### Hardware
We wanted a realistic way to control the car in the game, so we decided that we would use
our electrical engineering skills to create a steering wheel and pedals. We hope to include
force feedback in order for the user to get a better feel of how the car is acting in the
game. Additionally, we plan to have the following features:
- Steering Wheel
- Pedals
- Sequential Shifter
- Handbrake
- Ignition Key and Various Switches
- Telemetry Display

### Embedded Software
Some profound text will go here.
